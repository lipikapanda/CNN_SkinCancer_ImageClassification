# Melanoma Detection Using CNN

## Problem Statement

Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

This assignment uses a dataset of about 2357 images of skin cancer types. The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.

## Table of Contents
* Data Splitting to Test and Validation
* Data Visualisation(One from each class)
* Model 1 - Build and Analysis
* Model 2 - Build with Data Augmentation and Analysis
* Model 3 - Build with Augmentor and Rectified Class Imbalance
